	<h1>About the CED<sup>2</sup>AR Project</h1>
	<p>
		The <a href="http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/ldi/">Labor Dynamics Institute</a> in collaboration with 
		the <a href="http://ciser.cornell.edu/">Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research (CISER)</a> 
		has been <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Oct11/ILRcensus.html">awarded funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF)</a> 
		to build a Comprehensive Extensible Data Documentation and Access Repository (CED<sup>2</sup>AR) 
		designed to improve the documentation and discoverability of both public and restricted data 
		from the federal statistical system. 
		The CED<sup>2</sup>AR is based upon leading metadata standards 
		and is flexibly designed to ingest documentation from a variety of sources.

	<h1>CED<sup>2</sup>AR API Documentation</h1>
	<p>
		The CED<sup>2</sup>AR metadata repository is available for external searches via an open
		Application Programming Interface (API).  If you are a developer and would like to incorporate
		these services into your application, please <a href="">contact CISER</a> for more information.
		The API documentation is also included here for reference.
